                        Emigrating from South Korea to the United States in the early 1980s,[1] Kim's parents opened a liquor store in South Los Angeles, with Kim's father scarcely having a high-school education.[2] Jonathan Kim[3] was born in 1984[4] in Los Angeles.[1] Kim's mother worked as a substitute elementary school teacher while raising Kim and his younger brother.[2] In a 2018 interview with Annals of Emergency Medicine, Kim described himself as "the epitome of that quiet kid who just lacked complete self-confidence."[5]

                        At Santa Monica High School,[6] Kim received high grades in his classes, including several Advanced Placement, and participated in swimming and water polo;[2] he graduated in 2002. Kim received a Bachelor of Arts (summa cum laude) in mathematics from the University of San Diego (USD) in 2012, and his Doctor of Medicine from Harvard Medical School in 2016. In 2017, Kim completed his medical internship in emergency medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital.[6]
                        
                        Kim's father died before seeing his son join the US Navy.[2] As of January 2020, Kim was married[7] with three children.[8]
